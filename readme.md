Inside chocolate lava cake is the batter which has warmed during baking but hasnâ€™t fully set. The key is to bake just until the sides are set but the inside is still molten. A very small amount of flour is used in these cakes giving a rich creamy texture.

WE can also reheat this chocolate lava cake by putting it in the oven upside-down on a baking sheet at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.
